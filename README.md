# gosa-portfolio-180109
completely brand new to front-end web development, just trying to create a simple portfolio as practice. having a serious issues with aligning, can't seem to get the correct CSS code. i ended up using a table to place my photos and videos in, but i still can't figure out what else is needed to control the spacing between the photos and videos.
